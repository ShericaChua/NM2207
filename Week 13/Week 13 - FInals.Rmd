(1) What is the theme of your data story?
   - The theme of my data story is "San Francisco's Changing Tree Landscape: A Decade of Growth and Diversity."

(2) Why is it important to address this question?
   - It is important to address this question because the condition and evolution of a city's tree population have direct implications for environmental sustainability, air quality, and residents' quality of life. Understanding these changes allows for informed urban planning, conservation efforts, and assessing progress toward climate and environmental goals.

(3) Why do you think the data sources that you have curated can help you answer the question?
   - Comprehensive Overview: The combination of the number of different species, total tree counts, common species, and spatial distribution offers a comprehensive view of the tree population.
   - Temporal Analysis: By examining trends over the past decade, you can identify patterns, correlations, or anomalies in tree planting and survival
   - Geospatial Insights: The interactive map provides a spatial context, allowing for insights into the geographic distribution of trees, potentially highlighting areas that may require more attention or improvement.
   - Biodiversity Considerations: Analyzing the types of species planted and their distribution can offer insights into efforts to promote biodiversity and resilience in the urban ecosystem.


(4) What are the insights from the data and how are they depicted in plots?
   - Trends in Tree Planting: Are there specific years where there was a significant increase or decrease in tree planting? What factors might have contributed to these trends?
   - Species Diversity: Is there an upward trend in the number of different species planted each year? Are certain species becoming more or less prevalent?
   - Hotspots of Tree Density: Do certain areas consistently have a higher density of trees? Are there areas with lower tree counts that might benefit from targeted planting initiatives?
   - Success of Planting Initiatives: Analyzing the survival rates of planted trees can provide insights into the effectiveness of past planting initiatives.
   - Community Engagement: Understanding the location and types of trees can also provide insights into community engagement and participation in tree planting programs.


(5) How did you implement this entire project? Were there any new concepts that you learned to implement some aspects of it?
   - The project was implemented using Radiant software, which is a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization. I learned to use Radiant's interface to load and clean data, create plots using ggplot2, and build interactive elements with Shiny. I also developed skills in responsive web design principles to ensure a smooth and user-friendly interface. The integration of these concepts and tools allowed me to create an engaging and informative data story about San Francisco's trees.
